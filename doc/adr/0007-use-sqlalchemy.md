# 7. Implement SQLAlchemy as Database ORM

Date: 2025-02-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our application requires a flexible and maintainable way to interact with the database while ensuring scalability and security.
Writing raw SQL can be error-prone, difficult to maintain, and lacks built-in mechanisms for handling complex object relationships.
SQLAlchemy provides an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions, enhances code readability, and ensures compatibility with multiple database backends.
Using an ORM allows developers to work with Python objects instead of raw SQL queries, improving development efficiency and reducing the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.  

## Decision

We will use SQLAlchemy as our ORM to abstract database interactions and manage complex queries in a structured manner.
SQLAlchemy provides high-level ORM and a lower-level Core API, giving us flexibility in choosing the right approach for different use cases.
Its built-in migration support via Alembic ensures smooth schema evolution while maintaining database integrity.
Using an ORM also enables better maintainability by enforcing data modeling best practices and reducing redundant SQL code.  

## Consequences

This decision improves development speed and maintainability by allowing developers to work with Python objects instead of raw SQL.
However, ORM-generated queries may introduce performance overhead compared to hand-optimized SQL, requiring careful profiling and tuning.
Developers should understand SQLAlchemyâ€™s mechanics to avoid pitfalls such as lazy loading inefficiencies and excessive query generation.
While this approach increases abstraction, raw SQL can still be used for performance-critical queries where necessary.
