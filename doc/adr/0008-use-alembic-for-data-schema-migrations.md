# 8. Implement alembic for data schema migrations

Date: 2025-02-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context  

Our application requires a robust and version-controlled way to manage database schema changes in a Python-based environment.
Alembic is a lightweight and powerful migration tool designed for SQLAlchemy, which we use for database interactions.
It provides versioning, rollback capabilities, and automation for handling schema evolution efficiently.
Ensuring database consistency across environments while allowing for controlled schema modifications is critical for long-term maintainability.  

## Decision

We will use Alembic to manage database migrations, leveraging its versioning system to track schema changes systematically.
Alembic’s support for incremental, scripted migrations allows us to apply changes safely in development, testing, and production environments. Its integration with SQLAlchemy ensures compatibility with our ORM, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
Automated migration generation and rollback functionality will help streamline deployment processes and mitigate schema-related issues.  

## Consequences

This decision simplifies database schema management by providing a structured, repeatable approach to migrations.
Developers will need to follow best practices for writing and applying migrations to avoid conflicts and data integrity issues.
Alembic’s reliance on SQLAlchemy means it is best suited for projects using this ORM, limiting its applicability to raw SQL or other database frameworks.
Regular maintenance and review of migration history will be necessary to prevent schema drift and ensure clean versioning.
